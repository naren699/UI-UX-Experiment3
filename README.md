# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:
To perform a heuristic evaluation of Zomato and Swiggy based on standard usability principles. To identify usability problems and compare the UI/UX quality of both applications. To propose redesign improvements for Swiggy based on observed issues. To simulate A/B testing to measure the impact of proposed UI enhancements.

## Algorithm:

1. Open Zomato and Swiggy applications and observe their primary user flows.

2. Evaluate each app using Nielsen’s 10 heuristic principles.

3. Record observations for visibility, consistency, error handling, and navigation.

4. Compare both apps based on design, tracking, checkout flow, and accessibility.

5. Identify usability issues in Swiggy and list potential UI/UX improvements.

6. Create A/B testing scenarios for enhanced tracking UI and improved filter design.

7. Analyze expected metrics and determine the effectiveness of proposed redesigns.

## Output:

The heuristic evaluation showed that Zomato performed better in most usability areas. Swiggy displayed issues in tracking clarity, filter visibility, consistency, and error messaging. Proposed redesigns included clearer tracking UI, visible filters, and simplified checkout. A/B testing predictions showed higher satisfaction and faster task completion with improvements.

## Result:

The heuristic evaluation successfully identified critical usability differences between Zomato and Swiggy. Zomato provided a smoother and more intuitive user experience overall. The suggested redesigns for Swiggy are expected to improve user satisfaction and efficiency. A/B testing outcomes indicate that the proposed UI enhancements would significantly upgrade usability.
